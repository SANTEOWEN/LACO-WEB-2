                        <p>The following can file a complaint:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The LCCB Data Privacy Commission (LCCB-DPC), on its own initiative;</li>
                            <li>Those who have suffered a data privacy violation or personal data breach; and Persons
                                who are personally affected by a violation of the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act
                                No. 10173).</li>
                            <li>Persons who are the subject of the data privacy violation or personal data breach may

                        </ul>
                        <br />
                        <p>Those who are not personally affected by a data privacy violation or personal data breach

                        <p>Those who wish to file a complaint must comply with the rule of exhaustion of remedies. This
                            rule means that in filing the complaint, a complainant must be able to show that there was
                            an opportunity offered in good faith to have the respondent comply with any legal
                            obligations involving data protection and privacy.</p>
                        <br />
                        <h3>How To File A Complaint</h3>
                        <p>Formal complaints are made by filing a complaint-affidavit, together with copies of any
                            evidence and affidavits of any witnesses at the Data Privacy office.</p>
                        <br />
                        <h3>How To Deal With Complaints</h3>
                        <p>Once a complaint has been filed, an investigating officer will conduct the proceedings. The
                            investigating officer shall evaluate the complaint to determine whether its allegations
                            involve a violation of the Data Privacy Act or related issuances and if based on its
                            allegations, there is reason to believe that there is a privacy violation or personal data
                            breach.</p>
